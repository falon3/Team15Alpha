 * deal of functionality associated directly with the database itself. In order for this to
 * properly function we will be making use of the popular database ElasticSearch.
 *
 * Now suppose that we have a bunch of users, we want to be able to successfully manage
 * all of the user's individually, all the users within a list like format, and then a list of the
 * modifications that we want to successfully commit to the databae. Databae, we love it.
 *
 * This class will have the ability to pull various things from the database in which case
 * the application will pull relevant information that the applicaiton desires at that current
 * point of time.
