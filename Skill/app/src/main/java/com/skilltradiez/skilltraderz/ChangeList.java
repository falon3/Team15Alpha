/**
 * What is life without change?
 * I don't know, I am not a philosopher. Please don't ask me. Please... :(
 *
 * So in our application we make use of a lot of models, viewers and controllers (MVC is great!)
 * and so we need to have some way of informing all of these various parts about just WHAT on
 * Earth is going on in the rest of the application!
 *
 * (or Mars, if this application ever gets to Mars-- ooh or I might set my sights higher
 * and hope for Pluto or mayb- *cough cough*)
 *
 * So we create, in very common MVC fashion, a big beautiful w-...list.... of notifications. This
 * list is going to be populated with a large number of Notification objects that are described
 * in the notification class (Please don't make me type more, mercy!).
 *
 * When something changes in the application, who are you gonna call? (No, not ghostbusters)
 * The ChangeList!
 *
 * So we give the application to populate this big beautiful list of notifications with a ton
 * of different notifications that are tied to various parts of the application. Sounds awesome
 * right?! Well it gets even better! When the notification list is fully populated we are going
 * to let the user actually have a method that lets them push ALL of this to a particular user's
 * database! Now that is glorious, and majestic.
