/**
 * I suppose it might make quite a fascinating piece of contemporary art in which case we make
 * an application that is based around users without actually having any users present within
 * the application/.
 *
 * I, or rather we, are not planning to do modern art in this application. We are tryin to make an
 * application for ussers.... and so we have an ESSENTIAL CORE CLASS THAT IS GOING TO BE THE USERS
 * CLASS.
 *
 * This class is going to hold within itself all of the core functionality that the users may
 * actually need to have full functionality within our application. It holds a ton of attributes
 * all of which are PRIVATE that will store core essential data on the user, and it will
 * have methods (getters/setters) for all of these attributes that allow it so that the
 * user can have a proper flow tiwhtin the application itself.
 *
 * Code wise, think of this as a central hub for the user where this is the class that will
 * hold a bunch of other objects within itself that are associated with itself. This allows
 * very simple easy access reference throughout the rest of the program to access anything
 * related to this user. Life is simple, enjoy! :)
